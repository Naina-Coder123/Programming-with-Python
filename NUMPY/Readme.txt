NumPy is faster than Python lists mainly because:

Homogeneous Data Storage:
NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory, allowing efficient access and computation. Python lists can hold mixed types and are stored as pointers, which slows down operations.

Vectorized Operations:
NumPy performs operations on entire arrays at once (vectorization), using optimized C code under the hood. Python lists require explicit loops, which are slower.

Memory Efficiency:
NumPy uses less memory due to fixed data types and contiguous storage.

Example: Adding two arrays
import numpy as np

# NumPy array addition (fast, vectorized)
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result_np = a + b  # [5 7 9]

# Python list addition (slow, needs loop)
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
b_list = [4, 5, 6]
result_list = [x + y for x, y in zip(a_list, b_list)]  # [5, 7, 9]

Summary:
NumPy is faster because it uses contiguous memory, fixed data types, and vectorized operations, while Python lists are flexible but slower due to their internal structure and lack of vectorization.
